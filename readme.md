# Face Authentication Website

This Flask-based project provides a secure and reliable way to authenticate users through facial recognition technology. By leveraging the power of computer vision, this web application validates user logins in real-time by matching their face to a stored image. 

## Running the program
To run the program, you will need to:
- Have Python installed on your device.
- Install C++ compiler by Visual Studio.
- Type the following commands in the command line:

Don't forget to change the image path in the `main.py` file to match the image that you want to use.
